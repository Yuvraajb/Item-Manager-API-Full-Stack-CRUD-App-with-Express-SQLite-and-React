## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint         | Description             |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/items`     | List all items          |
| GET    | `/api/items/:id` | Get a single item by ID |
| POST   | `/api/items`     | Create a new item       |
| PUT    | `/api/items/:id` | Update an existing item |
| DELETE | `/api/items/:id` | Delete an item by ID    |

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm installed

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The backend will run at [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Running the Application

* Start both the backend and frontend as described above.
* Use the frontend UI or tools like Postman/cURL to interact with the API.

---

## Testing

### How to Run Tests

From the `backend` directory:

```bash
npm test
```

Or with coverage:

```bash
npx jest --coverage
```

### Testing Frameworks Used

* **Jest:** Unit, integration, and API testing, with coverage reports
* **Supertest:** For making HTTP requests to the Express API in tests

### Types of Tests

* **Unit Tests:** Test individual route logic and error handling
* **Integration Tests:** Verify database interaction
* **API Tests:** Ensure correct endpoint functionality and response

All CRUD operations and error scenarios are covered.
