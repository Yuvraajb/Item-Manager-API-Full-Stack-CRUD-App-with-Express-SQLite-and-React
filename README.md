## Features

- Add, view, update, and delete items
- RESTful API with full CRUD operations
- Persistent storage using SQLite
- React-based frontend for easy interaction
- Automated unit, integration, and API tests with high code coverage

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Frontend:** React (see `/frontend` directory)
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest, Supertest

---

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/items`     | List all items          |
| GET    | `/api/items/:id` | Get a single item by ID |
| POST   | `/api/items`     | Create a new item       |
| PUT    | `/api/items/:id` | Update an existing item |
| DELETE | `/api/items/:id` | Delete an item by ID    |

---

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The backend will run at [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Running the Application

- Start both the backend and frontend as described above.
- Use the frontend UI or tools like Postman/cURL to interact with the API.

---

## Testing

### How to Run Tests

From the `backend` directory:

```bash
npm test
```

Or with coverage:

```bash
npx jest --coverage
```

### Testing Frameworks Used

- **Jest:** Unit, integration, and API testing, with coverage reports
- **Supertest:** For making HTTP requests to the Express API in tests

### Types of Tests

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual route logic and error handling
- **Integration Tests:** Verify database interaction
- **API Tests:** Ensure correct endpoint functionality and response

All CRUD operations and error scenarios are covered.

---

## Test Coverage

This project achieves high code coverage for the backend API.

Sample coverage summary:

```
File      | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s
----------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
All files |   83.33 |       65 |   85.71 |   93.61 |
index.js  |   83.33 |       65 |   85.71 |   93.61 | 12,89-90
```

## CI/CD & Keploy Integration

This project integrates API testing into the CI/CD pipeline using [Keploy](https://keploy.io/) and GitHub Actions.

- **OpenAPI Schema** is included for the project.
- **Automated Keploy API tests** run on every push and pull request.
- The workflow can be found in `.github/workflows/keploy-ci.yml`.

**CI/CD Workflow Status Example:**
